# Learnings

Append-only kaizen log. Do not edit or delete prior entries. New entries go at the bottom.

Compaction: when this file exceeds 200 entries, the learnings-drain process archives entries older than 30 days to `/artifacts/meta/agent/{agent-name}/learnings-archive/` and distills recurring patterns into `/artifacts/meta/agent/{agent-name}/learnings-digest.md`.
